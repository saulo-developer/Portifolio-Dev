This is a portifolio — which I called it as a "Portifolio Dev" in english or "Portifólio Dev" in portuguese — from a perspective of a developer, to disclose his/her work as a fullstack dev.
The skills I mainly worked with were: CSS; and HTML. 
This is a copy project I made from Rocketseat (a website from Brazil, which teaches IT students to develop programming skills).
